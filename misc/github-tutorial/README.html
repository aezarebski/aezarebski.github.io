Welcome to <i>Git, GitHub and Reproducible Research</i>! In this tutorial we will
look at ways git and GitHub can help you with computational research, including
how make it more reproducible. You will learn the fundamentals of git and gain
practical experience in the use of GitHub. For those interested in learning more
about version control, there is also a list of <a href="#org3a8f849">additional resources</a> and some
<a href="#orgcbe5aa4">homework problems</a> at the end to test your understanding.
</p>

<p>
Please read through the <a href="#orge4374e8">background material</a> first then follow along with the <a href="#orge45922c">worked example</a>. You do not need any special software installed (everything is
done in the browser), however the worked example does make use of R and ggplot2.
Installing <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> is probably the easiest way to utilise these software. If you
find an error in this document, or would like to suggest an improvement, please
make a note of this in the <a href="https://github.com/aezarebski/github-tutorial/issues/new/choose">issue tracker</a> on GitHub.

These materials makes use of proprietary products and a simplified workflow in
order to emphasise the main concepts and to save on installation and
configuration time. Some references will be given at the end to direct you to
free and open source solutions and more sustainable workflows; the core ideas
are the same though, so understanding the material given here should make it
easier to migrate to more advanced methods in the future should the need for
them arise.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
This section provides some context for why you might care about git, GitHub and
reproducible research. This document only provides the absolute basics of these
topics but should get you started with them and help direct further learning.

<h3 id="orgba6842f"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> Version control</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
<i>Version control</i> refers to systems which help to manage the writing and
maintenance of things such as software, documents, and websites. These systems
were developed to manage large software projects but are useful at many levels.
For example, version control can help you avoid the following situation:
<code>my-analysis.R</code>, <code>my-analysis-final.R</code>, <code>my-analysis-final-again.R</code>, and so on.
Try coming back to that 3 months later when a reviewer asks you to re-run
something with a slight modification!

<h4 id="org73eb246">Reproducible research and Open research</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org73eb246">
<p>
In addition to helping <b>you</b> with organising your files, a version control
system and it's associated tooling can also help the scientific community by
helping to make your research reproducible and open.
</p>

<p>
For your computational research to be considered <i>reproducible,</i> it needs to be
described in such a way that others can replicate your results. For it to be
<i>open</i>, the materials (code, data and sufficient documentation) need to be
available for others. Simply dumping all of your code into something like GitHub
is not sufficient for your research to be considered reproducible.

<h3 id="org17e7d72"><span class="section-number-3">2.2.</span> Git</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
Created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds to help with the development of the Linux
kernel, git has become a fundamental tool in software development. In the 2021
Stackoverflow Developer Survey over \(90\%\) of respondents used git; it is
nearly synonymous with version control. If you intend to collaborate in the
writing of substantial amounts of code, taking the time to learn how to use git
is a good idea.
</p>

<p>
Working with git will be much easier if you get familiar with some of the
terminology first. Unless you are familiar with git already, you should at least
skim these before continuing.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3a02f43" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org3a02f43">Repository</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org3a02f43">
<p>
A <i>repository</i> is a directory containing your files and the history of all the
edits (see <a href="#org0c3c519">commit</a>) made to these files. You can have a repository that only
lives on your machine, but they are often shared on a platform such as GitHub.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0c3c519" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org0c3c519">Commit</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org0c3c519">
<p>
An edit to a file that you have recorded as part of the history of edits is
called a <i>commit</i>. It is both a noun and a verb, you commit an edit and the
<a href="#org3a02f43">repository</a> contains all of your commits. This can be thought of as a stronger
version of saving a file. Each commit gets a unique identifier (called a
<i>hash</i>). Sometimes we use "commit" to refer to the state of all the code after
an edit.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7a5900f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org7a5900f">Clone</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7a5900f">
<p>
When you make a copy of a <a href="#org3a02f43">repository</a> you are <i>cloning</i> that repository. The
resulting copy is referred to as a <i>clone</i>. Typically this will mean you have
downloaded a copy from a platform such as GitHub.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgade22dd" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgade22dd">Pull</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgade22dd">
<p>
Suppose you <a href="#org7a5900f">cloned</a> a repository a while ago and you want to get a copy of all
the <a href="#org0c3c519">commits</a> that have been made to the original repository since then. To get
these commits you <i>pull</i> them, which is a fancy way of saying updating your
files. This is sometimes referred to as <i>fetching</i>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5204a72" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org5204a72">Push</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5204a72">
<p>
If you have <a href="#org0c3c519">committed</a> some changes to your <a href="#org7a5900f">clone</a> of a <a href="#org3a02f43">repository</a> and want the
original repository to have these changes made, you <i>push</i> these changes. This
is a fancy way of saying use your edits to update the original files.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org86f11b4" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org86f11b4">Branch</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org86f11b4">
<p>
A <i>branch</i> is similar to a <a href="#org7a5900f">clone</a> in that it is a copy of a <a href="#org3a02f43">repository</a>. This
provides a more sophisticated way for people to work on their own version of
code, without messing up the main copy. This is not particularly important
unless you are collaborating with others on a project.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9bd7310" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org9bd7310">Merge</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9bd7310">
<p>
If someone has made some useful changes on their <a href="#org86f11b4">branch</a> the owner of the
repository may decide to include their commits in the main copy. This process of
including the changes on someone's branch is called <i>merging</i> the changes.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9207f09" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org9207f09">Fork</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9207f09">
<p>
When you make a copy of a repository that sits on your GitHub account. This is
similar to, but distinct from <a href="#org7a5900f">cloning</a> and making a <a href="#org86f11b4">branch</a>.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org246bde0">
<p>
GitHub, Inc. is a subsidiary of Microsoft. Their website provides freemium
hosting of git repositories. In addition to hosting the repositories, it offers
additional tools to assist with software development. We will make extensive use
of GitHub in this tutorial to avoid you needing to install anything on your
machine. If you are going to use git extensively, it would be wise to learn how
to do this from the command line or some other program.

<h3 id="org46395ac"><span class="section-number-3">2.4.</span> Zenodo</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
Zenodo is an open access archive operated by CERN which allows researchers to
archive research materials with a DOI which makes them easier to cite. This is a
more permanent form of storage than GitHub. It is easy to archive a particular
commit of a repository which is good practice if you want to refer to a
particular version of some code in a paper.

<div id="outline-container-orge45922c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge45922c"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Worked example</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Now that we have an understanding of version control and its associated tooling,
we can see an example of how this enables us to do more reproducible research.
Suppose you wanted to ensure that the analysis leading to Figure
<a href="#org6b65c2e">1</a> was reproducible. In this worked example we will work through
the process of setting up a repository and uploading the relevant files. A copy
of the resulting repository is available <a href="https://github.com/aezarebski/git-usage">here</a>.
</p>


<div id="org6b65c2e" class="figure">
<p><img src="./git-usage-1.png" alt="git-usage-1.png" width="500px" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>The percentage of developers who use git has increased since 2015. Data from the Stackoverflow Developer Survey is shown as black points and a least squares regression is shown as a blue line, the trend is not significant at \(95\%\).</p>
</div>

<p>
We will start by looking at the <a href="#orgdd65ff8">code and data</a> used in this analysis, then
consider how one might <a href="#org6e92577">organise the files</a>. Once we have the code in a sensible
state we can <a href="#org1962a7a">put it in a GitHub repository</a> and add some finishing touches such
as a <a href="#org679afd3">license</a>, some <a href="#orge9e1032">documentation</a>, and some additional <a href="#org63cc011">information about package
versions</a>. We then consider the situation in which <a href="#orgba717b6">changes</a> need to be made by a
collaborator.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgdd65ff8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgdd65ff8"><span class="section-number-3">3.1.</span> Code and data</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
Start by making a new directory called <code>git-usage</code> which will hold all our
files. The data and the code that generated this figure are included below. This
data should be saved in a called <code>stackoverflow-git-data.csv</code>.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-csv">year<span style="color: #a52a2a;">,</span>percentage

2021<span style="color: #a52a2a;">,</span>93.43
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We then need a script to carry out the analysis. Save the following code in a
file called <code>make-plot.R</code>
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

</pre>
</div>

<p>
Once we have run the <code>make-plot.R</code> script, the directory should contain four files
and have a structure like the following.
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org2a0b53e">
git-usage
├── git-usage.png
├── make-plot.R
├── regression-summary.txt
└── stackoverflow-git-data.csv
</pre>

<p>
In the next section we will go through cleaning this up so it is easier for
people (including yourself in the future) to make sense of this.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6e92577" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org6e92577"><span class="section-number-3">3.2.</span> Organising the data and code</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
As a first step we will use directories to impose a sensible structure to our
files. Organising files in this way is useful as it makes it far easier for
someone to understand what each file is needed for. Follow the following steps
(starting from within <code>git-usage</code>,) to organise your code more appropriately:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Make a directory called <code>src</code> and move <code>make-plot.R</code> there.</li>
<li>Make a directory called <code>data</code> and move <code>stackoverflow-git-data.csv</code> there.</li>
<li>Make a directory called <code>out</code> which we will write results to.</li>
<li>Fix the call to <code>read.csv</code> in <code>make-plot.R</code> so it can find the CSV since it
now lives in the <code>data</code> directory.</li>
<li>Fix the calls to <code>ggsave</code> and <code>sink</code> so they write their output to the <code>out</code>
directory.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Once you have done this, the R script should look like the following.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-R">sods_data <span style="color: #ba2f59; font-weight: bold;">&lt;-</span> read.csv<span style="color: #3a81c3;">(</span><span style="color: #2d9574;">"data/stackoverflow-git-data.csv"</span><span style="color: #3a81c3;">)</span>

...

ggsave<span style="color: #3a81c3;">(</span>filename = <span style="color: #2d9574;">"out/git-usage.png"</span>,
       plot = g,
       height = <span style="color: #4e3163;">7.4</span>,
       width = <span style="color: #4e3163;">10.5</span>,
       units = <span style="color: #2d9574;">"cm"</span><span style="color: #3a81c3;">)</span>

sink<span style="color: #3a81c3;">(</span>file = <span style="color: #2d9574;">"out/regression-summary.txt"</span><span style="color: #3a81c3;">)</span>
summary<span style="color: #3a81c3;">(</span>lm<span style="color: #6c3163;">(</span>percentage ~ year, data = sods_data<span style="color: #6c3163;">)</span><span style="color: #3a81c3;">)</span>
sink<span style="color: #3a81c3;">()</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Once you have run the code (with <code>git-usage</code> as your working directory), the
directory structure should look like the following. Note how the output files
now appear in the <code>out</code> directory. If you are running the script from an R REPL,
remember you can use <code>setwd</code> to specify the working directory.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
Now that our code is in a reasonable state, we can upload it to GitHub. If you
do not already have a GitHub account, please follow the instructions <a href="#orgf81e136">above</a>,
which describe how to make one. Once you have a GitHub account, you can follow
the following steps to upload these files:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Visit <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a> and create a new <a href="#org3a02f43">repository</a> by clicking <b>New</b>, you
will need to pick a name for the repository (I called mine <code>git-usage</code>.) The
default settings provided by GitHub are fine. Click <b>Create repository</b>.</li>
<li>We now need to <a href="#org0c3c519">commit</a> our files and <a href="#org5204a72">push</a> them to the remote repository.
However, since we are doing this through GitHub, it is all combined into a
single step. Click <b>creating a new file</b> to start the process of adding the
<code>src/make-plot.R</code> file.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Ensure the name of the file is <code>git-usage/src/make-plot.R</code>.</li>
<li>Copy-and-paste the code in <code>make-plot.R</code> into the text box provided.</li>
<li>Click <b>Commit new file</b> button.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Repeat this process with <code>data/stackoverflow-git-data.csv</code> and the output TXT
file. In the case of the PNG image, <code>git-usage.png</code>, you will need to use
<b>Upload file</b> instead of <b>Create new file</b>.</li>

<h3 id="org679afd3"><span class="section-number-3">3.4.</span> Adding a license</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-4">
<p>
A license specifies what people can do with your code. If you aren't sure what
license suits your needs, you might find <a href="https://choosealicense.com/">https://choosealicense.com/</a> has some
helpful information. Most of the time, I will opt for the MIT license.
</p>

<p>
There are two ways you might add a license. The manual method is to copy and
paste the license text into a file called <code>LICENSE</code> to your repository, filling in
<code>[year]</code> and <code>[fullname]</code> as appropriate. Alternatively, you can <b>Add file</b> and <b>Create
new file</b> and specify that the file will be called "LICENSE" and it will offer
you some templates to choose from. It will auto-fill the details of your name
and the year.

<h3 id="orge9e1032"><span class="section-number-3">3.5.</span> Adding a README</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-5">
<p>
When you encounter a repository online it can be difficult to understand what
its purpose is and how to use it. "README" is the name given to a file that
contains this sort of information. Typically these will be written in markdown
(similar to RMarkdown). Add a file called <code>README.md</code> to your repository with text
similar to the following.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-markdown">This repository contains an analysis of git usage through time.

To run this analysis use the following command:

<span style="color: #a094a2;">```</span>
<span style="color: #4e3163;">Rscript src/make-plot.R</span>
<span style="color: #a094a2;">```</span>

The input data is in <span style="color: #a094a2;">`</span><span style="color: #4e3163;">data</span><span style="color: #a094a2;">`</span> and the results are in <span style="color: #a094a2;">`</span><span style="color: #4e3163;">out</span><span style="color: #a094a2;">`</span>.

<h3 id="org63cc011"><span class="section-number-3">3.6.</span> Recording the session information</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-6">
<p>
Software gets updated, and sometimes these updates cause things to break. Where
possible, it is very good practise to include details of the versions of
software you have used. When working with R the <code>sessionInfo</code> command makes this
simple. Try adding the following to the end of the <code>make-plot.R</code> script.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-R">sink<span style="color: #3a81c3;">(</span>file = <span style="color: #2d9574;">"out/package-versions.txt"</span><span style="color: #3a81c3;">)</span>
sessionInfo<span style="color: #3a81c3;">()</span>
sink<span style="color: #3a81c3;">()</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The next time that you run this script, it will write a description of the
version of R you used and the versions of all the loaded packages to the file
<code>out/package-versions.txt</code>. Try running the script again to make sure this
additional file was generated and contains something similar to the following.

Once you have made the changes and re-run that script the figure in
<code>git-usage.png</code> will have changed &#x2014; it should look like Figure <a href="#orgd30a684">2</a>
now. Ordinarily, you would update the figure in the same way that you update
code, by committing the changes. However, this is tricky to do via the GitHub
website for image files, so instead, delete the file and upload the modified
one. At this point it might be interesting to move between the <code>main</code> branch and
your new branch to see how the files change between the two.
</p>

<p>
One motivation for branches is that you can make exploratory changes without
risking messing up your code on the main branch. If you have a collaborator that
wanted to try something, they could do so on a separate branch and then, if you
like their edits, you can <a href="#org9bd7310">merge</a> them into <code>main</code> as we are about to do now.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5762cca">
<p>
To <a href="#org9bd7310">merge</a> your changes via the website, go back to the main page of the
repository and you should see a new button, like the one shown in Figure
<a href="#orgc481191">4</a>, inviting you to compare the changes on this branch, i.e., to
inspect if you consider this work worthy of inclusion.
</p>

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 4: </span>A button appears to invite you to compare branches.</p>

<p>
Inspect the differences between the branches and if you are happy with them
create a pull request by clicking the button as shown in Figure
<a href="#org8ba8115">5</a>.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Once you have created the pull request, the next step is to <a href="#org9bd7310">merge</a> that branch
into the <code>main</code> branch. To do this you just need to click the button shown in
Figure <a href="#orgf416cd0">6</a>.
</p>


<div id="orgf416cd0" class="figure">
<p><img src="./merge-pull-request.png" alt="merge-pull-request.png" width="500px" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 6: </span>If you accept a pull request you can merge the changes with the Merge pull request button.</p>
</div>

<p>
Once a branch has been merged it will hang around until you delete it. Since
having old branches around can lead to confusion, it is sensible to delete them
afterwards. As shown in Figure <a href="#org94ebd9c">7</a> there is a button to achieve
this.
</p>


<div id="org94ebd9c" class="figure">

At this point you should only have a single branch left and it should have the
modifications to the figure. Congratulations on a reproducible analysis!
